        <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, I keep hearing about FOD checks. What exactly is FOD?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> FOD stands for Foreign Object Debris. Basically, anything that shouldn’t be on the ramp—stones, plastic, tools, even an old boarding pass blowing in the wind.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Seriously? That stuff can cause problems?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Absolutely. One loose bolt can turn into a flying bullet once an engine fires up. FOD may be small, but it plays dirty.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> What about a sandwich wrapper? That sounds harmless!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Tell that to an engine sucking it in at full throttle. That "harmless" wrapper could cost millions. FOD may be small, but its impact? Huge.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> what about water bottle?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Yep. One bottle sucked into a jet engine and boom—cha-ching! That’s one very expensive drink.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it. So when do we check for FOD?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Three times: pre-arrival, pre-departure, and post-departure. Think of it like a safety checklist—we check, then check again, then check after we’ve checked.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> And who’s responsible for that?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Everyone at the bay. No exceptions. If you’re breathing ramp air, you’re part of the FOD squad.</p></p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Alright! What should I be looking for exactly?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Anything that doesn’t belong—bolts, tools, plastics, lost items. If you wouldn’t want it flying into a jet engine, it’s FOD. When in doubt, pick it out!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it, Mr. Krish,! Eyes down, pockets empty, ramp clean!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> That’s the spirit! A clean ramp is a safe ramp. Let’s keep the jets happy—and off the snack diet!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Okay! And what do we do with the stuff we find?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Straight into the FOD bin. Every bay has one. Can’t miss it—it’s the bin that’s practically begging for attention.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> And if the bin’s not there?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Head over to the passenger ramp—we’ve got an FOD bin there too. No excuses. The only thing flying should be the aircraft, not garbage.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Copy that, Mr. Krish,! FOD in the bin, not in the engine!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Now you’re talking! Clean ramp, safe skies—that’s how we roll.

            <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, what’s the difference between jet ingest and jet blast? I keep mixing them up!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Good question! Jet ingest is like the engine’s vacuum cleaner—it sucks in air and anything nearby at the front. So, stay clear or you might get “swallowed”!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, what’s the difference between jet ingest and jet blast? Specifically, what happens behind the engine?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Behind the engine is where jet blast happens—it’s a fierce gust of air shooting out the back. Stand there, and you could get knocked over or hit by flying debris.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, what’s the difference between jet ingest and jet blast? How close can I safely get to these zones?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> When the engine’s on, keep at least 5.79 meters from the front—that’s the ingest danger zone. And from the rear, a safe 60 meters away to avoid the blast. Think of it as giving the engine its personal space!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, what’s the difference between jet ingest and jet blast? Now I’m clear—it’s like respecting a grumpy giant!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! Respect the giant, stay alert, stay outside ERA when engine is on and you’ll be safe on the ramp every time.</p>

<p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, when is it actually safe to approach the aircraft at the bay? I don’t want to be the guy who walks into a spinning propeller!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Good question! Think of the aircraft like a sleeping dragon—you don’t want to wake it up too soon. Wait until the engines are off, ACB is turned off, chocks are in place, and the engineer gives the thumbs up.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> By the way, where exactly is the ACB located? I want to be sure I’m checking the right place.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Great to ask! On an Airbus, the ACBs are located on top and bottom of the fuselage. For ATR aircraft, you’ll find them on top of the tail and also on the bottom of the fuselage. Knowing this helps you verify that the ACB is properly turned off before approaching.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Wait, what exactly is the fuselage?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Ah, good one! The fuselage is basically the main body of the aircraft — the big central part where the passengers sit and the cargo is stored. Think of it like the airplane’s torso.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So basically, if ACB is on and  I rush in, I’m asking for trouble?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! Patience is your best safety gear here. Approaching too early is like trying to hug a cactus—painful and unnecessary.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it, I’ll personally check the engines, ACB locations, and chocks before waiting for the engineer’s “all clear.” No cactus hugs for me!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Perfect! Safe, smart, and with no prickly surprises. You’re officially on the express train to ramp training greatness!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Thank you! Credits to you for putting up with all my questions — you deserve a medal... or at least a really big coffee!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Haha, no medal needed — just remember: patience is key, and if you survive my jokes, you’re ready for anything!</p>  <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Remember:</p> <ul> <li>A/C engines are off</li> <li>ACB is turned off (on Airbus: top & bottom of fuselage; on ATR: top of tail & bottom of fuselage)</li> <li>Chocks are in place</li> <li>Engineer gives the thumbs up</li> </ul>

              </div>
            <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, how many cones do we use for the Airbus A320 and the ATR?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Great question! For the A320, you place 11 cones around the aircraft, like little sentinels guarding the plane. The ATR gets 10 cones—almost like a VIP rope line but with cones!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Nice! And what about chocks? How many do we need for each?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> In normal weather, the A320 uses 8 chocks—four on each wheel, making sure the plane stays put like a stubborn mule. The ATR uses 6 chocks, keeping things tight and safe.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> What if the wind decides to mess with us? Do we need more chocks?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Absolutely! If the wind speed goes above 25 knots, the A320 gets 4 extra chocks, making a total of 12. That’s like calling in backup to hold the plane steady. The ATR sticks with 6 chocks—tough little plane!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> What about the cones? Do we keep them all when it’s windy?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Nope! If wind speed is above 25 knots, cones have to be removed. Leaving them out is like giving the wind some bowling pins—definitely dangerous for everyone on the ramp!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So cones and chocks are like the bodyguards of the plane, huh?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! Without them, our planes might just roll away or get too cozy with the neighbors. Safety first, always!</p><p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Here’s a quick reference table for you to review. Make sure to study it well—it will be part of your assessment.</p>

            <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, all aircraft kinda look the same from the ground. How do I tell them apart?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Ah, my young ramp warrior, knowing your aircraft is like recognizing your relatives at a wedding—look closely, they all have unique features!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Okay, let's start with the A320?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> The A320 is your standard short-haul hero—180 to 186 passengers, 4 doors, and 3 cargo holds. Think of it as the "Toyota" of aircraft. Reliable and everywhere.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> And the A321?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> That’s the A320’s big brother with more muscle—222 to 232 passengers, 6 doors, and 5 compartments. Longer and leaner. If the A320 is a sedan, the A321 is a limo.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> What about the ATR? That one looks... different.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Yup! The ATR is the countryside cousin—smaller with 78 passengers, 1 door, and a quirky 4-compartment hold setup. Props not jets. And the ACB lights? One on the tail and one under the belly, like a plane with a nightlight!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> And the Airbuses have their ACB lights?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Right—both top and bottom of the fuselage. Easy to spot if you know where to look. Like aircraft bling!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it! So it’s all about doors, lavs, holds, and the plane’s personality!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! If you know your aircraft, the ramp becomes a lot less confusing—and way more fun.</p>

            <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, I'm confused. Why are the door bays different for A320 and A321?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Great question! Think of the A321 as the A320’s taller cousin who grew longer by 7 meters—and needs a different set of doors to stretch them out.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So what doors do I need to remember?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> For the A320, it's L1, L2, and R1—like a cozy 3-room apartment. For the A321, it's L1, L4, and l4—because the A321 threw a party and added a door at the back!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Why L4 for A321 though? That’s way back!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly. The A321 is longer, so using L4 helps with faster boarding and deplaning—no traffic jams in the aisle. It's like opening both ends of a subway car during rush hour.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Makes sense. So, just memorize the combo, right?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Yep! Treat it like a cheat code: A320 = L1, L2, R1. A321 = L1, L4, R1. No guessing, just winning.</p>

<img src="img/hotelmode.png" alt="hotelmode">
            <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, I saw someone mention “Hotel Mode” on the ATR. Are we checking into a flying hotel now?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Ha! Not quite. “Hotel Mode” sounds fancy, but it just means the aircraft is using its APU to power systems while the engines are off.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So… it’s like turning on the lights and AC in the plane without starting the engines?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! The APU is like the aircraft’s portable generator. It keeps things comfy and powered up while the big engines take a nap.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it. But is Hotel Mode after the GPU is connected?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Nope! In Hotel Mode, the aircraft powers itself. If it’s using a GPU, that’s external power—not Hotel Mode. Think of Hotel Mode as the aircraft making its own coffee without room service.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So GPU is room service, and Hotel Mode is the plane brewing its own coffee?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Nailed it! The ATR uses its APU to run electrical systems, lights, avionics, and air conditioning—everything except the engines. It's self-sufficient.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Is it safe to work around the plane in Hotel Mode?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Safer than when engines are running, yes. But always remember—the APU exhaust is hot, and systems are live. Stay alert, wear PPE, and treat the aircraft with respect.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Copy that. Hotel Mode: passengers relax, ramp crew sweat… with caution!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Welcome to aviation!</p>

Think of it like a recipe card for the aircraft—it tells us where the “ingredients” (passengers, cargo, baggage) are placed so the plane doesn’t turn into a flying seesaw.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Flying seesaw?!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! If we load too much in the back, the nose points up. Too much in the front, and the tail gets jealous. The LDM helps balance the load—so we fly smooth and happy.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So, it’s like weightlifting for planes—keep it balanced or things go sideways.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Spot on! Always check the LDM before finalizing loading. It’s not just paperwork—it’s how we keep gravity on our side!</p>

            <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, what exactly is an LIR? Sounds like a secret mission code.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Ha! Not quite James Bond, but it is important. LIR stands for Load Instruction Report. It tells you what goes where on the aircraft—kind of like a recipe for loading a plane.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So it’s like the plane’s grocery list?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> More like its diet plan. It says how much cargo, where it should be loaded, and in what order—so the aircraft stays balanced and doesn’t do an unplanned backflip.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> That would definitely ruin someone’s vacation.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! That’s why the LIR must be followed *exactly* as printed. No freelancing, no guessing. Even small mistakes can throw off the aircraft’s center of gravity.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it! Follow the LIR like it’s gospel.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Right! Treat it like your playlist at the gym—no skipping, no shuffling. Load it as written, and the plane stays happy—and so do the passengers.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Makes sense. But what’s actually in the LIR? Like, what columns or info should I be looking at?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Good question. The LIR is usually divided into three main columns. First, there's the <strong>Arrival Load</strong>—that shows the cargo, mail, and baggage already on the aircraft when it arrives.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So that’s what’s staying onboard?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly. Then comes the <strong>Planned Loading</strong>—that’s what we intend to load for the departing flight: more cargo, mail, and checked baggage.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it. And the third column?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> The third column is <strong>Final Loading</strong>. That’s what actually made it onto the aircraft after check-in counters close. It's the confirmed, real deal—no more changes after that.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So Arrival Load, Planned Loading, and Final Loading. Three columns telling us what’s on, what’s going in, and what finally made it.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Bingo! Think of it as past, present, and confirmed future. Every item has to be loaded according to plan—or else we update the plan and make sure it's approved before the door shuts.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Understood, Mr. Krish,. No surprises for the aircraft!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> That’s the spirit. The LIR keeps the aircraft balanced, efficient, and most importantly—safe.</p>
